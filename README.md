# Debugging Cat Expense React App Interview

There are several bugs in this code. Your task is to find and fix them. You can use any tools you like to debug the code. You can also add comments to the code to explain your changes.

You can ask for a hint but your score will be deducted.

## Challenge 1 - React Rendering Mental Model
Run `yarn dev`, open http://localhost:5173/
Try to type `cat expense` in label
and you will see how the app is super slow and janky. 

Find the bug and fix it and explain why it was slow and janky.


Try to add cat expense
and you will see how the app is super slow and janky. 

Find the bug and fix it and explain why it was slow and janky.

### Note: Don't change fibonacci.tsx, factorial.tsx

## Challenge 2 - React Common Issue
Run `yarn dev`, open http://localhost:5173/
When the cat expense dialog is open, you can see that the cat fact is fetched multiple times.

This behavior is not expected. Cat Fact should be fetched only once when opening the dialog.

Find the bug and fix it and explain why it was slow and janky.

## Challenge 3 - TypeScript

Some TypeScript interfaces has been generated by `"openapi:cat": "openapi-typescript https://catfact.ninja/docs/api-docs.json -o src/types/cat-fact.ts"` in package.json
In `src/types/cat-fact.ts`, you will see the generated types.
Go to `src/services/catService.ts`, and fix all `TOOO` type in this file without `any` type.

## Challenge 4 - Algorithm

There is tree component in `src/components/tree/tree.tsx`.
Implement a generated data structure function `generateNxNTree` that **accept N** to generate N x N depth for the tree view component `Tree`.

The tree view should look like this.

N (Depth) = 3

- - Node 3.2.N
- Node 3.3
- - Node 3.3.1
- - Node 3.3.2
- - Node 3.3.3

Each node must possible to toggle open and close. The default state is open.
